ISS Orbit Visualisation Example

I wrote a short example of one way to visualise orbits of satellites or other space objects. Here, I use CesiumJS, which is a wonderful
software that you can tap into by simple referencing the JavaScript library and Stylesheets in your web page. You'll
to get a key from their website to use it though.

The rendering of the scenes happens fully on the client side inside the browser and can require a substantial amount of memory
and computing resources if you work with complex scenes. However, this one is simple enough to be enjoyed on systems with not
to many resources.
